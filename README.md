                                                                    Customer Order Analytics

 Project Description
 The Customer Order Analytics API is a service that allows users to manage customer data and their orders. It includes various endpoints to register customers, place orders, retrieve order information, and generate analytics related to the orders. The system is backed by an H2 database that stores customer and order data.

 This project enables operations such as:
 Registering a new customer.
 Placing an order.
 Retrieving orders for a customer.
 Admin functionality to view and manage all orders.
 Analytics on order data, such as the most profitable customers and seasonal revenue.
 The system also allows querying different statistics about the order system, such as retention rates, product category performance, and common order sizes.
 Prerequisites
 To run this project, youâ€™ll need the following:
 Java 11+ (if using Spring Boot or similar Java-based frameworks)
 Maven or Gradle (to manage dependencies and build the project)
 H2 Database (an embedded in-memory database for development, or use a file-based instance for persistence)
 Postman (for testing API endpoints)
 Project Setup and Running the API

 Step 1: Clone the Repository
 Clone the project repository to your local machine:
 bash
 Copy
 git clone https://github.com/your_username/customer-order-analytics.git
 cd customer-order-analytics
 Step 2: Install Dependencies
 If you are using Maven:
 bash
 Copy
 mvn clean install
 gradle build
 Step 3: Database Setup (H2)
 If you are using the in-memory H2 database, there is no need for setup. The database will be created on the fly when the application runs.
 
 For persistent H2 (i.e., file-based database), make sure to edit the application.properties or application.yml file to set the JDBC connection string:
 Example in application.properties for persistent database:
 spring.datasource.url=jdbc:h2:file:/path/to/your/database/customer_order_analytics;DB_CLOSE_DELAY=-1;DB_CLOSE_ON_EXIT=FALSE
 spring.datasource.driverClassName=org.h2.Driver
 spring.datasource.username=sa
 spring.datasource.password=password
 spring.jpa.database-platform=org.hibernate.dialect.H2Dialect
//using H2 database For Testing Purpose 

 Step 4: Running the API
 With Maven:
 bash
 Copy
 mvn spring-boot:run
 With Gradle:
 bash
 Copy
 gradle bootRun
 Once the application is running, you can access the API at:
 arduino
 Copy
 http://localhost:8088

 Step 5: Testing with Postman
 Import Postman Collection: To test the API, import the Customer Order Analytics Postman collection file (customer_order_analytics.postman_collection.json).
 Open Postman.
 Go to the "Collections" tab and click "Import."
 Choose the .json collection file.
 Import the collection into Postman.
 Run API Tests: You can now run API tests for operations like: 
 Registering a new customer.
 Placing an order.
 Viewing orders for a customer.
 Canceling an order.
 Updating order statuses (admin only).
 Viewing various analytics like most profitable customers and monthly retention rates.
 API Endpoints Overview
 Customer Operations
 POST /customers: Register a new customer.
 POST /customers/:customer_id/orders: Place an order for a customer.
 GET /customers/:customer_id/orders: Retrieve orders for a customer.
 DELETE /customers/:customer_id/orders/:order_id: Cancel an order.
 Admin Operations
 GET /admin/orders: Retrieve all orders for admin purposes.
 PUT /admin/orders/:order_id/status: Update the status of an order.
 Analytics Operations
 GET /analytics/top-customers: Get the top 10 most profitable customers.
 GET /analytics/retention: Get the monthly retention rate.
 GET /analytics/processing-times: Find the longest order processing times.
 GET /analytics/category-aov: Find the best and worst-performing product categories.
 GET /analytics/seasonal-revenue: Retrieve seasonal revenue for holidays.
 GET /analytics/order-sizes: Get the most common order sizes.
 Execution Flow
 Customer Registration:
 A new customer can be registered using the POST /customers endpoint. The request should include customer details such as name and email. Upon successful registration, a new customer record will be created in the H2 database.
 Placing an Order:
 After registering a customer, an order can be placed for the customer using the POST /customers/:customer_id/orders endpoint. The body of the request will include the order details, including product names, categories, quantities, and prices. The order is then stored in the database, and a response is returned to confirm the successful creation of the order.
 Admin Operations:
 Admins can view all orders through the GET /admin/orders endpoint. Admins can also update the order status via PUT /admin/orders/:order_id/status to mark orders as SHIPPED, CANCELLED, etc.
 Admins can delete orders through DELETE /customers/:customer_id/orders/:order_id.
 Analytics:
 Analytics endpoints allow retrieving insights from the data, such as the top customers by revenue, monthly retention rates, order processing times, and more.
